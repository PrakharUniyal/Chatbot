2.Once you have defined your work type, fix a budget according to the suitable configuration.\n
3.Some key points while looking at laptop configs are:\n
â€¢ RAM: 8GB is OK, also they are almost always upgradeable\n
â€¢ SSD(solid-state drives) offer faster storage than HDD (hard-disk drives).So if you are able to find a laptop with an ssd within your budget it will benefit you a lot.\n
â€¢ For basic programming, even simple laptops will suffice, but say you want to perform heavy video editing or android development or gaming, then you will need one with a good GPU and RAM.\n
