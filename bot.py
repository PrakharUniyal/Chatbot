Everything is relative and dependent on your batch's performance. Although, if you study diligently (not compromising on the extra-curriculars), I believe you are good to go
- If you attend all your classes diligently, and solve the assignments, etc. you would be able to get a cgpa above 8. Keep in mind that there is relative grading in most courses, and other students will also be working hard to get a nice cgpa. In the end it depends on your hardwork.
- IIT Mandi offers a liberal branch change policy which allows you to study a branch of your interest. But always be prepared for the branch that you are getting.
