# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method

## Contributing code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Checkout a new branch : `git checkout -b <name>_<feature>`.
3. Make changes.
4. Stage only required files to commit : `git add <Files_Changed>`. Don't add files you did not intentionally changed.
5. Commit with a proper message `git commit -m "message"`.
6. Push the branch : `git push origin <name>_<feature>`. Remember NOT to push `main` branch.
7. Create a Pull Request.
8. After the PR is merged, delete the local branch : `git checkout main && git branch -D <name>_<feature>`.
9. Pull the latest main branch : `git pull`.
10. Repeat Steps 2 to 6 for further contributions.

NOTE: Don't delete the branch unless the PR is merged.

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
